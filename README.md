Computers are really good at answering questions with single, verifiable answers. But, humans are often still better at answering questions about opinions, recommendations, or personal experiences.  Humans are better at addressing subjective questions that require a deeper, multidimensional understanding of context - something computers aren't trained to do wellâ€¦yet..

Some may be helpful and others interesting. Some are simple right or wrong.
